    "**Requirements:**\n",
    "- Use Pandas to filter the dataset into two parts: one for weekdays and another for weekends.\n",
    "- Calculate the average number of rides and the average fare for both weekdays and weekends.\n",
    "- Group the data based on the average distance traveled into short, medium, and long trips for each category (weekday and weekend) and calculate the average fare for each group.\n",
